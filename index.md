title:          Diet Coach App 1.22 Beta
layout:         home
---

Thank you for agreeing to help RP with beta testing the new features we've been working on for the Diet Coach App!

This beta is intended for folks who have already been using the RP Diet Coach app and are familiar with macros, planning and tracking foods and meals, etc.

The documentation provided on this site highlights only the chief differences between the stable production/public version of the app and the new version that we're building, so it is not intended to be comprehensive. It will guide you through understanding the new [conceptual paradigms](/concepts/) and [features](/features/) at a pretty high level.

The primary purpose of our beta program is to uncover bugs related to things like app crashes, app freezes, inability to perform specific operations, etc. While we are not looking specifically for feedback on the UI or UX, we certainly welcome your thoughts on issues of usability and general feature requests.

Thank you for your help!

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
