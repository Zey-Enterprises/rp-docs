# What is your refund policy for the diet app?

# Is the RP Diet Coach app the right product for me?

# How the RP Diet Coach app different from other apps?

The RP Diet App builds you a plan exactly and only for your specific needs, schedule, and preferences. It’s the least generic diet plan that’s ever been sold.

The app tells you what macros to hit meal by meal, and give you exact weights of every selected food you have to eat to meet those macros. If you want to maximize your chances of success, eat only the foods listed in the plan, or very similar whole foods. If you’re going to eat foods not listed, please count them to within 5g per macro. So if a your plan says to consume a meal of 20g of protein, 35g of carbs and 10g of fat, and you consume foods with a total of 17g protein, 37g carbs, and 11g fat, you’re in the clear!

# Does the RP Diet Coach app support special diets?

## I have a food allergy(ies). Can RP still work for me? Of course!

This plan offers extensive flexibility. YOU get to choose all food sources (within their allotted portions) from our list of recommended foods, so you can be sure to steer clear of anything you need to.

# What equipment will I need to succeed?

1. A food scale. Nothing fancy; just a scale that weighs food to the nearest gram.

1. A bathroom scale. Again, nothing fancy, just a digital scale that will let you weight yourself so that you can tell the app what you weigh and it can adjust your diet from there.

1. Access to training equipment. We highly recommend you train at a commercial gym, as the equipment there will allow you to get your best results in fat loss and muscle retention or gain. If you train at a non-commercial gym, like a box, or even in your own home, that's just fine. Can you use this app without training at all? Yes, but results will be highly limited.

# Creating an app account and signing in

# Will this app work for me if I am not training?

# What kind of training does RP recommend for various diet phases to give me the best results?

You don't HAVE to do any kind of training, but the more you train, the more muscle you'll put on or keep on, the healthier you will be, and the better your shape will be. Any kind of training works, but at least 2-3 sessions of weight training per week are recommended for best results.

If you’re dieting to lose fat OR gain muscle, high volume physique training is the best approach for either losing fat without losing muscle, or adding muscle without too much fat. If you’re doing sport training during these phases, backing off on that training a bit and adding a bit more physique training (plenty of sets and reps so long as you can recover) might be a good idea. If you’d like some guidance on this kind of training, look no further than the male and female physique templates:

  * [RP Female Physique Template](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/female-physique-training-templates){:target="&lowbar;blank"}

If you’re in a maintenance phase, the kind of training you do is up to you, but, if you’d like guidance on weightlifting or powerlifting training, we’ve got apps than can help:

* [RP Powerlifting Strength Training Template](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/pl-strength-templates){:target="&lowbar;blank"}

If you’re still a bit confused on matching your training to your diet, please check out this [short video by Dr. Mike Israetel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifNJ0pZpmx0){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.

## Would the RP diet benefit someone who’s NOT training?

Absolutely. If you or members of your friend or family circle do not plan on training right now, we recommend our [Healthy Diet Templates](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/shop/healthy-diet-templates/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} for a balanced eating lifestyle, including a lower carb option for those who prefer it. They can still use the app if they’d like, but the templates might be a bit simpler for those who don’t train and just want and eating guide for general health.

# How does the app keep me safe while dieting?

## Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

To calculate your personalized safe caloric limits, the app calculates a Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) for your specific body information and schedule. All increases or decreased to your nutrients are anchored around this calculation of how much energy your body needs to maintain the same weight and function at its best. In order to lose weight you have to eat less than your TDEE and in order to gain weight you have to eat more than your TDEE.

Our TDEE calculation starts from your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy per day that you'd need if you were asleep the entire day. It then takes into account the duration and intensity of your workouts and your basic activity level for the day in the form of an Activity Factor (AF) along with your age in years (A), your height in centimeters (H), and your weight in kilograms (W).

## Is it possible to run a fat loss diet for too long or run too many fat loss diets back to back?

It absolutely is, and RP's Dr Melissa Davis has some [valuable insight on the subject](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/chronic-dieting/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}. We STRONGLY recommend never running two fat loss diets back to back without at least a 2/3 length maintenance period between them. (Maintenance should be at least 2/3 as long as the fat loss diet that preceded it.)
