Welcome to the RP Diet Coach App documentation. This resource is designed to provide comprehensive guidance on utilizing the app to achieve your nutrition and fitness goals.

# Current Focus: Version 1.22 Beta

At present, our documentation emphasizes the new features and functionalities of the [1.22 beta version of the Diet Coach App](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/). This beta introduces significant enhancements aimed at improving user experience and dietary planning and tracking accuracy. We encourage users to explore these new features and provide feedback to assist us in refining the app.

# Integration of Diet-Specific Content

We've consolidated diet-specific information from our [Help Center](https://help.rpstrength.com/hc/en-us){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and [FAQs](https://faq.rpdiet.app/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} into this documentation. However, we are not porting over the documentation from version 1.21 of the app. As version 1.22 comes out of beta, this site will be the the centralized location for all relevant dietary guidance, streamlining your experience and supporting your journey toward optimal physique, performance, and health.
