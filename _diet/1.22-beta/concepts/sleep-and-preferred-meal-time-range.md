We are moving away from the "sleep" concept in the app in favor of configuring the time range in which you want the app to program meals for you.

While the previous versions of the app provided modest macro adjustments on the basis of the duration of your sleep, we have found that this is a minor optimization in the algorithm and not worth the added complexity of sleep sessions straddling day boundaries when you're trying to configure your schedule.

When you're first configuring a diet or editing your [schedule template](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/concepts/schedule/), you can now specify, day by day, when you want the app to program meals for you.

You can also specify your preferences for a day in the current week:
1. From the "Schedule" tab, tap on the "..." (horizontal kabob) overflow menu.
2. Tap on "Edit schedule".
3. Tap on the day for which you want to make the change.
4. Tap on the "..." (horizontal kabob) overflow menu for the day.
5. Tap on "Set first/last meal times".
6. After saving any changes, if you want the app to immediately reprogram the meals on that day, use the [Auto-configure](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/auto-configure/) (ðŸª„ icon or "Auo-configure day" option from the overflow menu for the day) with the ["Adjust times of unlocked meals" option](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/auto-configure/#adjust-times-of-unlocked-meals).

For instance, instead of saying that you sleep from 9pm on Thursday to 5am on Friday and 10pm on Friday to 7am on Saturday, you would now specify that you want the app to program meals from 5am to 10pm on Friday.

Note that this time range only affects the RP algorithm's automatic programming during [Weekly Planning](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/weekly-review-and-weekly-planning/) and when using the ["Adjust times of unlocked meals" option of Auto-configure](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/auto-configure/#adjust-times-of-unlocked-meals). If you make changes to a day in the current week without running [Auto-configure](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/auto-configure/), the app will _not_ automatically reprogram any of your meals, and those preferences will not carry over to your [schedule template](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/concepts/schedule/) or your next week.

And remember: You always have the power to add meals outside that window, whether in the current week's schedule as you're running your diet, in [Weekly Planning](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/weekly-review-and-weekly-planning/), or in your [schedule template](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/concepts/schedule/) as a "manual meal".
