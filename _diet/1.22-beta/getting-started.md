# Who the Beta is For

You should only sign up to participate in the beta if you're already familiar with the current publicly available RP Diet Coach App and are willing to endure some bugs here and there, even though the beta version is already in a pretty stable, usable state.

Keep in mind that, while the app can be run on tablets and on certain Mac computers, we discourage you from running it on those platforms, as we have not verified compatibility or stability, and so we cannot support you if you run into bugs.

# Enrolling in the Beta

## iOS

Join the "Open External Beta" TestFlight group [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/k6rTNPTe).

## Android

Join the beta testing track:
* Click [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rp.rpdiet) if you're on your Android phone.
* Click [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.rp.rpdiet){:target="&lowbar;blank"} if you're on your laptop or desktop browser (but make sure to install the app on a phone).

# No Going Back

By enrolling in the beta, you are committing to enduring some amount of instability and potential disruption to being able to run your diet for the remainder of the beta period.

This is because upgrading to this new version fundamentally changes the structure of your diet data, and there is no downgrade path to go back to the previous data structure.

We anticipate that the beta will last no longer than through the end of June 2025, but unforeseen circumstance may require us to run the beta for longer.

Once we have developed a stable version that we are comfortable publishing publicly, your participation in the beta program will end, and you will upgrade to the latest version of the publicly available production app.

# Feature Incomplete

This beta represents a major change to the RP Diet Coach App, and so we have had to minimize its scope to only those changes and features that are absolutely required to run successful diets.

We are already aware of numerous improvements that we will make after we launch this new version publicly.

If there are features and functionalities you wish the app had, they're probably already on our backlog! But that shouldn't stop you from providing feedback anyway--that will help us to gauge the relative importance of those features.

Of course, depending on what we learn, we may significantly change the functionality of certain features and remove others. The fact that something works a particular way in this beta does not guarantee that it will work the same way when we launch publicly. We may also change the visual look and feel of the app.

# Nondisclosure

With a public beta like this, it's inevitable that some folks will post screenshots and otherwise comment publicly on this new version, whether because they didn't read this section or because, in their excitement, they forgot!

Particularly because there is so much in flux with the app, we request that you try hard to remember to not post anything on social media or on any public forum about this new version and what you learn about it. We know you're excited about it, but the point of this public beta is for you to deliver constructive criticism to us directly and then allow us to make needed app updates. We don't want to get the public's hopes up or otherwise get them worked up about things we'd fix before launching it to them!

# How to Provide Feedback

To deliver feedback, please email diet-app-beta@rpstrength.com. Provide the device model and OS version, your app build number, screenshots or a screen recording, and as much information about what you were doing, what you expected to happen, what actually happened, and whether you can reliably reproduce the problem. Timely feedback (ie, as soon as the problem occurs) is most helpful, as that allows us to investigate issues that could be connected with your specific account data before you take further action that might wipe out evidence that provides valuable context.

To get the important version/build numbers, in the app, navigate to the "Me" tab, then "Help", then "About". Either include those in your email or take a screenshot of that page.
