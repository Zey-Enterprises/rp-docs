# No Going Back

By enrolling in the beta, you are committing to enduring some amount of instability and potential disruption to being able to run your diet for the remainder of the beta period.

This is because upgrading to this new version fundamentally changes the structure of your diet data, and there is no downgrade path to go back to the previous data structure.

We anticipate that the beta will last no longer than through the end of June 2025, but unforeseen circumstance may require us to run the beta for longer.

Once we have developed a stable version that we are comfortable publishing publicly, your participation in the beta program will end, and you will upgrade to the latest version of the publicly available production app.

# How to Provide Feedback

To deliver feedback, please email diet-app-beta@rpstrength.com. Provide the device model and OS version [TO DO: explain how to get this], your app build number [TO DO: explain how to get this], screenshots or a screen recording [TO DO: explain how to do this], and as much information about what you were doing, what you expected to happen, what actually happened, and whether you can reliably reproduce the problem. Timely feedback (ie, as soon as the problem occurs) is most helpful, as that allows us to investigate issues that could be connected with your specific account data before you take further action that might wipe out evidence that provides valuable context.
