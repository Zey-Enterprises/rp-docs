Thank you for agreeing to help RP with beta testing the new features we've been working on for the Diet Coach App!

This beta is intended for folks who have already been using the RP Diet Coach app and are familiar with macros, planning and tracking foods and meals, etc.

The documentation provided on this site highlights only the chief differences between the stable production/public version of the app and the new version that we're building, so it is not intended to be comprehensive. It will guide you through understanding the new conceptual paradigms and features at a pretty high level.

The primary purpose of our beta program is to uncover bugs related to things like app crashes, app freezes, inability to perform specific operations, etc. While we are not looking specifically for feedback on the UI or UX, we certainly welcome your thoughts on issues of usability and general feature requests.

To deliver feedback, please email arthur@rpstrength.com. Provide the device model and OS version [TO DO: explain how to get this], your app build number [TO DO: explain how to get this], screenshots or a screen recording [TO DO: explain how to do this], and as much information about what you were doing, what you expected to happen, what actually happened, and whether you can reliably reproduce the problem. Timely feedback (ie, as soon as the problem occurs) is most helpful, as that allows us to investigate issues that could be connected with your specific account data before you take further action that might wipe out evidence that provides valuable context.

Thank you for your help!
