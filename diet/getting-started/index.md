# No Going Back

By enrolling in the beta, you are committing to enduring some amount of instability and potential disruption to being able to run your diet for the remainder of the beta period.

This is because upgrading to this new version fundamentally changes the structure of your diet data, and there is no downgrade path to go back to the previous data structure.

We anticipate that the beta will last no longer than through the end of June 2025, but unforeseen circumstance may require us to run the beta for longer.

Once we have developed a stable version that we are comfortable publishing publicly, your participation in the beta program will end, and you will upgrade to the latest version of the publicly available production app.
